Basics of IoT Communication from [Architecting the Internet of Things by Microsoft @ TechEd North America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMHQu_X0Ijk)

- Telemetry: Information flowing from a device to other systems for conveying status of device and environment
- Inquiries: Requests from devices looking to gather required information or to initiate activities, I Am Ok!
- Commands: Command from other systems to a device or a group of devices to perform specific activities
- Notifications: Information flowing from other systems to a device (group) for conveying status changes

> A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service-orientation are independent of any vendor, product or technology. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)
