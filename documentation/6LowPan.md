# 6LoWPAN

> 6LoWPAN is an acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks. 6LoWPAN is the name of a concluded working group in the Internet area of the IETF. Wikipedia

> The 6LoWPAN concept originated from the idea that "the Internet Protocol could and should be applied even to the smallest devices" and that low-power devices with limited processing capabilities should be able to participate in the Internet of Things. Wikipedia

## Examples

> Setup a 6LoWPAN network. If youâ€™re familiar with 802.15.4 Wireless Sensor Networks, you could easily setup your Raspberry Pi as a border router, that would expose the CoAP server on its radio interface. You could then use e.g. Contiki and the Erbium CoAP client to write a simple app that will run on a mote and talk CoAP to read the temperature, or control the LED!
