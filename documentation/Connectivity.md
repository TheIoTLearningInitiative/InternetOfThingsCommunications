# Connectivity

> One of the strengths of the Internet of Things (IoT) is its capability to network things. As Greenough and Camhi say in [The Internet Of Things 2015 Report](http://www.businessinsider.com/internet-of-things-2015-forecasts-of-the-industrial-iot-connected-home-and-more-2015-10) of Business Insider, IoT is and will continue to change the way business, governments, and consumers are interacting with the world around us. Because of this main purpose to connect people and things in general, the most important thing is actually connectivity.

> Forbes reported that during 2015 4,800 connected end points are added every minute, and a prediction of [McKinsey & Company](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_internet_of_things_sizing_up_the_opportunity) forecasts 30 billion IoT objects connected by 2020.

> Nowadays, we cannot predict exactly how communication protocols will evolve, but we can breakdown wireless communication protocols in 6 standards:

## Meta-Eca

> meta-eca is a Yocto layer that is concentrating on networking and it ties together various open source connectivity components like ConnMan for connection management,
oFono for cellular access, BlueZ for Bluetooth connectivity and neard for NFC support.
ECA (Embedded Connectivity Appliance) is a platform for prototyping networking technologies. A mobile access point is created here using the meta-eca layer [Meta Eca](https://metaeca.wordpress.com/)

## LoRa

> LoRa® Alliance is an open, non-profit association of members that believe the internet of things era is now. Our mission to standardize Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) being deployed around the world to enable Internet of Things (IoT), machine-to-machine (M2M), and smart city, and industrial applications. The Alliance members will collaborate to drive the global success of the LoRa protocol (LoRaWAN), by sharing knowledge and experience to guarantee interoperability between operators in one open global standard.

> LoRaWAN is designed to provide Low Power Wide Area Network with features specifically needed to support low-cost, mobile, secure bi-directional communication for Internet of Things (IoT), machine-to-machine (M2M), and smart city, and industrial applications. It is optimized for low power consumption and to support large networks with millions and millions of devices. It has innovative features, support redundant operation, location, low-cost, low-power and can even run on energy harvesting technologies enabling the mobility and ease of use to Internet of Things.

## ZigBee

> ZigBee is a specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols used to create personal area networks built from small, low-power digital radios. ZigBee is based on an IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Its low power consumption limits transmission distances to 10–100 meters line-of-sight, depending on power output and environmental characteristics ... *From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*
