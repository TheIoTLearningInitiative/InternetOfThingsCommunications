# Connectivity

>One of the strengths of the Internet of Things (IoT) is its capability to network things. As Greenough and Camhi say in [The Internet Of Things 2015 Report](http://www.businessinsider.com/internet-of-things-2015-forecasts-of-the-industrial-iot-connected-home-and-more-2015-10) of Business Insider, IoT is and will continue to change the way business, governments, and consumers are interacting with the world around us. Because of this main purpose to connect people and things in general, the most important thing is actually connectivity.

>Forbes reported that during 2015 4,800 connected end points are added every minute, and a prediction of [McKinsey & Company](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_internet_of_things_sizing_up_the_opportunity) forecasts 30 billion IoT objects connected by 2020.
