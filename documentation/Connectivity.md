# Connectivity

> One of the strengths of the Internet of Things (IoT) is its capability to network things. As Greenough and Camhi say in [The Internet Of Things 2015 Report](http://www.businessinsider.com/internet-of-things-2015-forecasts-of-the-industrial-iot-connected-home-and-more-2015-10) of Business Insider, IoT is and will continue to change the way business, governments, and consumers are interacting with the world around us. Because of this main purpose to connect people and things in general, the most important thing is actually connectivity.

> Forbes reported that during 2015 4,800 connected end points are added every minute, and a prediction of [McKinsey & Company](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_internet_of_things_sizing_up_the_opportunity) forecasts 30 billion IoT objects connected by 2020.

> Nowadays, we cannot predict exactly how communication protocols will evolve, but we can breakdown wireless communication protocols in 6 standards:

1. Satellite
2. WiFi
3. Radio Frequency (RF)
4. RFID
5. Bluetooth
6. NFC

### iBeacon

> iBeacon is a protocol developed by Apple and introduced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2013. Various vendors have since made iBeacon-compatible hardware transmitters - typically called beacons - a class of Bluetooth low energy (LE) devices that broadcast their identifier to nearby portable electronic devices. The technology enables smartphones, tablets and other devices to perform actions when in close proximity to an iBeacon. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon)
