# Development Boards

> A Bluetooth stack is software that refers to an implementation of the Bluetooth protocol stack.

> Bluetooth stacks can be roughly divided into two distinct categories:
> > General-purpose implementations that are written with emphasis on feature-richness and flexibility, usually for desktop computers. Support for additional Bluetooth profiles can typically be added through drivers.
> > Embedded system implementations intended for use in devices where resources are limited and demands are lower, such as Bluetooth peripheral devices.[1]
