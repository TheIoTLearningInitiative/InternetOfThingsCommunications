Lightweight M2M
==

> OMA Lightweight M2M is a protocol from the Open Mobile Alliance for M2M or IoT device management. Lightweight M2M enabler defines the application layer communication protocol between a LWM2M Server and a LWM2M Client, which is located in a LWM2M Device. The OMA Lightweight M2M enabler includes device management and service enablement for LWM2M Devices. The target LWM2M Devices for this enabler are mainly resource constrained devices. Therefore, this enabler makes use of a light and compact protocol as well as an efficient resource data model. It provides a choice for the M2M Service Provider to deploy a M2M system to provide service to the M2M User. It is frequently used with CoAP. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMA_LWM2M)
