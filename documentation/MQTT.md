 MQ Telemetry Transport
==

## MQTT

> MQTT is a light-weight protocol used for Machine to Machine (M2M) communication. MQTT used a publish/subscribe message forwarding model built on top of TCP/IP protocol.

> MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.

### Mosquitto

> Mosquitto is an open source (BSD licensed) message broker that implements the MQ Telemetry Transport protocol versions 3.1 and 3.1.1. MQTT provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model.

>MQTT (a.k.a. mosquitto) is perfect for mobile and embedded devices because of its lightweight (in processing, memory management and bandwidth) messaging protocol. 

> For this protocol, notice that it lacks of encryption in its base, otherwise it would add an important overhead to the connection. Security at the application level requires a lot of work.
