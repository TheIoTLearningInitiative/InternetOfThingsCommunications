# Protocols

> In telecommunications, a communications protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity. These are the rules or standard that defines the syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol)

## AllJoyn

> A persistent publish/subscribe solution promoted by Qualcomm. This protocol has the limitation of being mainly targeted towards home electronics. This protocol includes code for marshalling and unmarshalling (encode/decode) data and suffers from the same size and proxy problems as MQTT

## XMPP

> An open source persistent publish/subscribe protocol that can also be tunneled over HTTP. Data is encoded in XML, thus it includes a huge code size footprint for the device

## 6LoWPAN

> 6LoWPAN is an acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks. 6LoWPAN is the name of a concluded working group in the Internet area of the IETF. Wikipedia

> The 6LoWPAN concept originated from the idea that "the Internet Protocol could and should be applied even to the smallest devices" and that low-power devices with limited processing capabilities should be able to participate in the Internet of Things. Wikipedia

## ModBus

> Modbus is a serial communications protocol originally published by Modicon (now Schneider Electric) in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Simple and robust, it has since become a de facto standard communication protocol, and it is now a commonly available means of connecting industrial electronic devices. Wikipedia

> Since Modbus protocol is just a messaging structure, it is independent of the underlying physical layer. It is traditionally implemented using RS232, RS422, or RS485. The Request. The function code in the request tells the addressed slave device what kind of action to perform.
