## Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)

> Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a software protocol intended to be used in very simple electronics devices that allows them to communicate interactively over the Internet. It is particularly targeted for small low power sensors, switches, valves and similar components that need to be controlled or supervised remotely, through standard Internet networks ... *From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*

>CoAp has a request/response model protocol, clients can make GET, PUT, POST and DELETE requests to resources. Please notice that CoAp does not have SSL/TLS ecryption isn't available over UDP, CoAP makes use of DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security). The default level of encryption is equivalent to a 3,072-bit RSA key. Also, CoAp lacks of a publish-subscribe message queue.

Protocols
==
> In telecommunications, a communications protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity. These are the rules or standard that defines the syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol)

- [Postscapes Internet of Things Protocols & Standards](http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-protocols)

## IPv6

> Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4. Wikipedia

- [IPv6 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6)

## Ajax, Web services, RESTful communication protocols

> These sit on top of HTTP, thus suffering from the same limitations as HTTP. Many of these protocols also require extensive processing and have a huge code size footprint. Many service providers promote the use of these protocols since their backend infrastructure is based on standard web servers that cannot handle any other type of protocol than HTTP.

## RESTful API (Representational State Transfer)

> In computing, representational state transfer (REST) is the software architectural style of the World Wide Web. REST's coordinated set of constraints, applied to the design of components in a distributed hypermedia system, can lead to a higher-performing and more maintainable software architecture. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)

> To the extent that systems conform to the constraints of REST they can be called RESTful. RESTful systems typically, but not always, communicate over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) with the same HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that web browsers use to retrieve web pages and to send data to remote servers.[4] REST systems interface with external systems as web resources identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), for example /people/tom, which can be operated upon using standard verbs such as DELETE /people/tom. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)

## MQTT

> MQTT is a light-weight protocol used for Machine to Machine (M2M) communication. MQTT used a publish/subscribe message forwarding model built on top of TCP/IP protocol.

> MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.

## Advanced Message Queuing Protocol

> The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organizations.  It connects systems, feeds business processes with the information they need and reliably transmits onward the instructions that achieve their goals.

## Weave

> Weave* is a communications protocol that supports discovery, provisioning, and authentication so that devices can connect and interact with one another, the Internet, and your mobile platforms. The Weave protocol helps IoT developers extend the reach of mobile apps to the physical world. Developers can build one app to control multiple devices that leverage Google services.

> Weave is a communications platform for IoT devices that enables device setup, phone-to-device-to-cloud communication, and user interaction from mobile devices and the web.

It is particularly targeted for small low power sensors, switches, valves and similar components that need to be controlled or supervised remotely, through standard Internet networks ... *From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*

## AllJoyn

> A persistent publish/subscribe solution promoted by Qualcomm. This protocol has the limitation of being mainly targeted towards home electronics. This protocol includes code for marshalling and unmarshalling (encode/decode) data and suffers from the same size and proxy problems as MQTT

## XMPP

> An open source persistent publish/subscribe protocol that can also be tunneled over HTTP. Data is encoded in XML, thus it includes a huge code size footprint for the device

## 6LoWPAN

> 6LoWPAN is an acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks. 6LoWPAN is the name of a concluded working group in the Internet area of the IETF. Wikipedia

> The 6LoWPAN concept originated from the idea that "the Internet Protocol could and should be applied even to the smallest devices" and that low-power devices with limited processing capabilities should be able to participate in the Internet of Things. Wikipedia

[6LoWPAN Interoperability](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daniel-6lowpan-interoperability-01)

## ModBus

> Modbus is a serial communications protocol originally published by Modicon (now Schneider Electric) in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Simple and robust, it has since become a de facto standard communication protocol, and it is now a commonly available means of connecting industrial electronic devices. Wikipedia

> Since Modbus protocol is just a messaging structure, it is independent of the underlying physical layer. It is traditionally implemented using RS232, RS422, or RS485. The Request. The function code in the request tells the addressed slave device what kind of action to perform.
