# Protocols

> In telecommunications, a communications protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity. These are the rules or standard that defines the syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol)

## ModBus

> Modbus is a serial communications protocol originally published by Modicon (now Schneider Electric) in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Simple and robust, it has since become a de facto standard communication protocol, and it is now a commonly available means of connecting industrial electronic devices. Wikipedia

> Since Modbus protocol is just a messaging structure, it is independent of the underlying physical layer. It is traditionally implemented using RS232, RS422, or RS485. The Request. The function code in the request tells the addressed slave device what kind of action to perform.
