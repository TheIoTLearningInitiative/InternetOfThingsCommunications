Basics of IoT Communication from [Architecting the Internet of Things by Microsoft @ TechEd North America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMHQu_X0Ijk)

- Telemetry: Information flowing from a device to other systems for conveying status of device and environment
- Inquiries: Requests from devices looking to gather required information or to initiate activities, I Am Ok!
- Commands: Command from other systems to a device or a group of devices to perform specific activities
- Notifications: Information flowing from other systems to a device (group) for conveying status changes

> A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service-orientation are independent of any vendor, product or technology. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)

This section contains all data that is missing. You might find it not structed, that is ok, important thing is not to forget about it.

## Terminology

### MQ Publish/Subscribe Model

[IBM Interconnect 2015 - Publish/subscribe in an IBM MQ network ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBq3oUBZ-9s)

- Make it extendable
- Rapidly changing set of topic strings
- Avoid excessively wide or deep dynamic topic tress

Components

- Topic String
- Topic Object
- Object Attributes
- Object Security
- Types of Subscriptions

Publications

- Always Succesful? Might, if Durable and Persistent

## Workshop

Big time to work on for

- REST create an example
- MQTT using IBM Bluemix
- AMQP using IBM MQ Light
- Z-Wave using [Post Z-Wave Data to Node Red](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/cee6c09c-a315-4b04-ad14-57d6a60fa8bb/entry/post_z_wave_data_to_node_red?lang=en)
