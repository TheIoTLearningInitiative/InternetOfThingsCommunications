> These sit on top of HTTP, thus suffering from the same limitations as HTTP. Many of these protocols also require extensive processing and have a huge code size footprint. Many service providers promote the use of these protocols since their backend infrastructure is based on standard web servers that cannot handle any other type of protocol than HTTP.

# RESTful API (Representational State Transfer)

> In computing, representational state transfer (REST) is the software architectural style of the World Wide Web. REST's coordinated set of constraints, applied to the design of components in a distributed hypermedia system, can lead to a higher-performing and more maintainable software architecture. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)

> To the extent that systems conform to the constraints of REST they can be called RESTful. RESTful systems typically, but not always, communicate over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) with the same HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that web browsers use to retrieve web pages and to send data to remote servers.[4] REST systems interface with external systems as web resources identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), for example /people/tom, which can be operated upon using standard verbs such as DELETE /people/tom.

## API Creation

> Creating and exposing APIs allows your web application to interact with other applications through machine-to-machine communication. API creation frameworks... [FullStackPython](http://www.fullstackpython.com/api-creation.html)

## Flask

> Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions. [Flask Homepage](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

> Itâ€™s time to write your first REST API. This guide assumes you have a working understanding of Flask, and that you have already installed both Flask and Flask-RESTful. [Here]([http://flask-restful-cn.readthedocs.org/en/0.3.4/quickstart.html)

## Flask-RESTful

> Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs. It is a lightweight abstraction that works with your existing ORM/libraries. Flask-RESTful encourages best practices with minimal setup. If you are familiar with Flask, Flask-RESTful should be easy to pick up.
